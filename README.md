# Mojobot

Meet **Mojo**: a curious tabby cat who lives in this repo.

Mojobot is a friendly **chatbot** that answers questions in Mojo’s voice—playful, a little cheeky, and (usually) helpful.

## What it does

- **Chat with Mojo** about whatever’s on your mind
- Mojo can pull from a **Diary** (a small knowledge base) so answers can be grounded in “things Mojo knows”
- The Diary can be **updated** as Mojo learns new facts, stories, and preferences

## The Diary (knowledge base)

Think of the Diary as Mojo’s memory.

- Add new entries when Mojo discovers something
- Update or refine existing entries when details change
- Keep it lighthearted, factual, or both—Mojo won’t judge (much)

## How it’s built (quick peek)

Without getting too technical:

- Runs on **AWS** for the cloud bits
- Uses **Terraform** to set up infrastructure in a repeatable way
- Uses **GitHub Actions** to automatically test and deploy changes

If Mojo replies with a slow blink, that means “thank you.”
